                          BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

Requirements

    Java 1.6
    Maven 3

Regular build, execute all end-to-end tests

    mvn clean verify

Also execute mutation tests and produce code coverage reports
(they can be found from the /target/pit-reports directories)

    mvn clean verify -P coverage-report

Looking at dependencies etc. requires first executing the package
phase, because other modules depend on jumi-actors-maven-plugin to be
found from the Maven reactor

    mvn package dependency:tree

Some other useful commands

    mvn versions:display-plugin-updates
    mvn versions:display-dependency-updates
