OK - unit tests for fi.jumi.core.results (before we start adding more events)
	OK - test SuiteEventDemuxer
	OK - test SuiteResultsSummary
	OK - TestNotifier#fireFailure: add citations about when tests are considered to be passing and failing (based on SuiteResultsSummary's tests?)

!! - progress bar
	OK - create SuiteProgressMeter
	OK - refactor SuiteProgressMeter:
		OK - move FileState manipulation from SuiteProgressMeter#onTestFinished into RunState#onTestFinished and remove RunState#currentTest
		OK - create FileState#onTestFound
		OK - make more fields final
		OK - free memory in onRunFinished and onTestFileFinished
	OK - SuiteListener: add events onTestFileFound, onAllTestFilesFound, onTestFileFinished
		OK - add methods to interface
		OK - hook onAllTestFilesFound
		OK - hook onTestFileFound
		OK - hook onTestFileFinished
		OK - update SuiteMother
	OK - TextUI: show percentages of how much is completed, about once per second (on each event check the time since last status printing)
		OK - add fi.jumi.launcher.ui.Printer#printMeta
		OK - create TextProgressBar
		OK - use it in TextUI
			OK - print in updateWithMessage right before printing anything else?
			OK - reprint after visiting a run in TextUI.SuitePrinter#onRunFinished
			OK - check output visually; may need more newlines in PlainTextPrinter (e.g. printMetaIncremental followed by printMetaLine or printOut)
	OK - SuiteProgressMeterTest: explicit test that suite may finish before reaching 100%
	OK - TextProgressBar: start in indeterminate mode?, also set other defaults on field initialization (allow method chaining for easy initialization)
	!! - tweak progress bar visuals
		- use hard-coded ASCII art for the progress bar's middle part
		- use rounding; 99% should mean full middle part (without end part)
		- on abrupt suite completion, show empty space: "[=======   ]"
		- change TextUI to produce "[-----=====-----=====-----=====-----=====-----=====]" to allow visualizing with 2% precision

- better toStrings for actor logging
	- write a generic test for daemon log: ThreadPoolExecutor should be the only class that has "@hashcode" showing in the logs (/@[0-9a-f]{6-8}/), all others should have custom toString methods
	- fi.jumi.core.runs.RunEventNormalizer (show testFile)
	- fi.jumi.core.suite.SuiteRunner$1FireTestFileFinished et al?
	- org.specsy.core.SpecRun(spec, pathToExecute), org.specsy.bootstrap.ClassSpec(testClass)

- release
	OK - tidy up release notes
	OK - bump version
	- release
	- web: FAQ "why create a new test runner", document the three main reasons
	- promote

- plugin system for custom DriverFinders (keep it minimal, nearly walking skeleton level, until we have more plugins)
	- hook into fi.jumi.core.drivers.DriverFinderFactory
	- move JUnit compatibility into its own module
		- create jumi-junit.jar
		- extract it automatically to ~/.jumi/plugins, the same way as the daemon jar
		- tell to daemon as system property what plugins to load: e.g. -Djumi.plugin.path=C:/plugin.jar;C:/another.jar (separated by path.separator)
		- load each plugin in a separete plugin classloader, with access to test classloader and to jumi-core
			- at first make the test classloader the parent of the plugin classloader (it'll work as long as we don't hide jumi-core from the test classloader, after which the plugin classloader might need two parents or use context classloader)
	- refactor JUnitCompatibilityDriverFinder et al to avoid reflection
	- refactor tests that use JUnitCompatibilityDriver.class.getName() instead of instanceOf checks (in DriverFinderFactoryTest)
	- investigate maven-shade-plugin; can we now turn on minimizing? it used to remove the JUnitCompatibilityDriver from jumi-daemon.jar
		- experiment:
			- how much is daemon jar minimized? if it minimizes only a little, it might not be worth it
			- otherwise: write a test that the daemon jar contains everything from the jumi-core

- ignoring tests
	- ignoring without running a test
	- ignoring after test has started
	- JUnit @Ignore
		- update the test in fi.jumi.test.JUnitCompatibilityTest
		- implement fi.jumi.core.junit.JUnitRunListenerAdapter#testIgnored (JUnitCompatibilityDriverTest)
	- JUnit assumptions
		- update the test in fi.jumi.test.JUnitCompatibilityTest
		- implement fi.jumi.core.junit.JUnitRunListenerAdapter#testAssumptionFailure (JUnitCompatibilityDriverTest)

- release
	- tidy up release notes
	- bump version
	- release
	- promote

- make option 2 explicit by adding a test for it; check for "nihao: ??" and "umlauts: ???" on US-ASCII
	> - when default charset is ISO-8859-1 (fi.jumi.test.StandardOutputTest#compensates_for_the_default_charset_of_the_daemon_process), Unicode chars are lost already when they are captured (nihao becomes ??); should we do something about it?
	>	(1) We could have an internal PrintStream which uses UTF-8/16 and capture losslessly from it, after which it's routed to a PrintStream which uses the actual encoding (might interfere with writing binary data to stdout).
	>	(2) Or then keep it as is. That would be the way that System.out works normally. Principle of least surprise?

- misc refactoring (choose some, defer others)
	- prepend TestFile as context information to the message in fi.jumi.core.runs.RunEventNormalizer#onInternalError?
	- create a custom taglet (as independent project) for cross-references from public API's javadocs to tests: e.g. {@ref com.example.FooTest#someTestName}
		http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/javadoc/taglet/overview.html
		http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/jdk/api/javadoc/taglet/com/sun/tools/doclets/Taglet.html

		http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-137483.html
		http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-javadoc-plugin/examples/taglet-configuration.html
	- DaemonConfiguration: refactor the code for parsing command line parameters
		fi.jumi.core.config.DaemonConfigurationBuilder#parseProgramArgs
		fi.jumi.core.config.DaemonConfiguration#toProgramArgs
		fi.jumi.core.config.DaemonConfiguration#JUMI_HOME and other constants
	- thread-safety-checker: when an inner class is missing the annotation, use the annotation of the enclosing class or default to @NotThreadSafe when the enclosing class has any concurrency annotation
	- replace SuiteRunnerIntegrationHelper with TestBench?
	- consider implementing SynchronizedPrintStream using something else than CGLIB (ASM? Tapestry's Plastic?) to make the JAR smaller
	- after upgrading to (presumably) JUnit 4.11, refactor BuildTest's parameterized descriptions
		https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/pull/145
		https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/pull/393
		- also use junit:junit instead of junit:junit-dep, since it's now a proper Maven artifact
	- check whether we still have many ASM versions we have on classpath (caliper depends on ASM 3), block "asm:*" artifacts with maven-enforcer-plugin?
	- make JUnit print a thread dump when a test times out due to @Test(timeout)
		- improve JUnit's test timeouts to show a stack trace of the timed out test, to help debugging sporadic timeouts in RunningTestsTest
	- evaluate whether some of the concurrent tests could be made simpler by using MultithreadedTC
		http://code.google.com/p/multithreadedtc/
	- BuildTest: make sure that jumi-daemon.jar contains everything from jumi-api.jar no matter what
		- test the test by adding an unused class to jumi-api
		- add includes if necessary: http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/examples/includes-excludes.html
	- fix Maven's pomPropertiesFile element, get rid of the current workaround of a separate build.properties
		http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MSHARED-154
		http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10102818/custom-values-in-maven-pom-properties-file
		<archive> element: http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-jar-plugin/jar-mojo.html
		<pomPropertiesFile> element: http://maven.apache.org/shared/maven-archiver/index.html
	- there might be unnecessary eventizers in fi.jumi.daemon.Main and /jumi-core/pom.xml
		- create EventizerUsageStatistics (extends EventizerProvider), print usage statistics when program exits
	- organize the project so that it's possible to run unit tests separate from end-to-end tests
		- put end-to-end tests in their own package, test.fi.jumi?
		- or use JUnit categories, maybe with a custom runner?
		- or use ClasspathSuite?
	- evaluate JarJar or ProGuard, maybe it could minimize the jars better than the shade plugin by removing also unused methods
		http://sonatype.github.com/jarjar-maven-plugin/
		http://pyx4me.com/pyx4me-maven-plugins/proguard-maven-plugin/
		https://github.com/wvengen/proguard-maven-plugin (uses newer version of ProGuard)
		1. run shade plugin to embed all dependencies and create the dependency-reduced POM
		2. run proguard to minimize the JAR at method level and preverify (in and out files must be different?)
		3. replace the main artifact
			http://mojo.codehaus.org/build-helper-maven-plugin/attach-artifact-mojo.html
	- consider logging with MinLog http://code.google.com/p/minlog/
		or create our own clone, since it's just one file (and )
		- actors: extract AbstractMessageLogger from PrintStreamMessageLogger
		- create logger specific implementation of AbstractMessageLogger
		- customize MinLog's output to use microsecond accuracy, similar to PrintStreamMessageLogger

- write daemon output to log file
	- use ProcessBuilder.redirectOutput to write the log file (else the process would hang when the launcher JVM exits)
		- write log to JUMI_HOME/run/*/console.log
		- default JUMI_HOME to ~/.jumi
	- update e2e tests to read the output from the log file
	- get rid of fi.jumi.launcher.remote.ProcessStartingDaemonSummoner#copyInBackground
		- don't create background threads in the launcher automatically (the tests should create them explicitly, if any)
		- also remove the hack in fi.jumi.test.ReleasingResourcesTest#launcher_stops_the_threads_it_started
	- update ErrorHandlingTest#gives_an_error_if_starting_the_daemon_process_failed
		- show the path to the daemon log file in the error message
		- consider showing the log file path for all internal errors? or leave it for later, for another mechanism to tell stats about the process?

- minor release
	- tidy up release notes
	- release
	- promote

- end-to-end tests: persistent daemon process
	- spike communicating over memory-mapped files (see below)
	- should drive better design on launcher side
	- connect to existing process
		- cancel idleTimeout if somebody connects again (unit test only?)
	- if daemon dies unexpectedly (System.exit/halt, JVM crash etc.), report it and restart next time
		http://vanillajava.blogspot.com/2011/12/test-complete-failure-of-jvm.html
	- how to show unfinished test runs in the TextUI? (both JVM crash unfinishing all tests, and buggy testing framework unfinishing some tests)
	- if daemon disconnects due to network problem, reconnect and resume where we were left? (should not happen with MMFs?)
		- should not exit the JVM (due to idle timeout) while tests are running
	- make it reliable

- communicate using memory-mapped files?

	http://javarevisited.blogspot.fi/2012/01/memorymapped-file-and-io-in-java.html
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5943365/java-tcp-ip-socket-latency-stuck-at-50-s-microseconds-used-for-java-ipc
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6096485/how-to-dynamically-expand-a-memory-mapped-file
	https://github.com/peter-lawrey/Java-Chronicle (see how IPC is done here)
	- benefits:
		- more secure than sockets (uses file system permissions)
		- should be faster (benchmark latency and throughput)
		- automatically saved to file for later use
		- no need to close socket connections
		- no need for a networking library
	- disadvantages:
		- how to manage multiple writers? one file per writer?
		- probably requires polling to get informed about updates
	- need to find out how to do synchronization
		http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4743380/controlling-read-writes-to-memory-mapped-files-windows
	- after implementing, consider refactoring the following places:
		fi.jumi.core.TestRunCoordinator#addSuiteListener
		fi.jumi.daemon.DaemonNetworkEndpoint#onConnected
		fi.jumi.launcher.remote.RemoteSuiteLauncher#onDisconnected

- run tests in a loop on a weakly ordered, multi-core CPU, to look for cache coherency issues
	- where to find a multi-core ARM for a test drive? and are the newer ARMs anyhow cache coherent?
		http://www.calxeda.com/trystack/
		http://trystack.org/
	- are there Itaniums (IA64) on any cloud for rent?
	- Azul's Vega should have a relaxed memory model; ask for co-operation, also to ensure scalability?

- write performance tests
	- test: suite with a hundred test classes, each with a hundred tests, some of which also do printing; measure total time of running the suite
	- experiment with different queue implementations, for example ConcurrentLinkedQueue
	- try following the single writer principle: http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/2011/09/single-writer-principle.html
		- for example: separate queue for each test worker (implies parallelism = locally sequential, except for slow tests?, use a work stealing executor?) and one thread which loops through them and writes to the coordinator actor queue

- "Error creating shaded jar", probably an issue with NTFS's pending delete and the shade plugin
	- make a bug request, maybe also a patch
