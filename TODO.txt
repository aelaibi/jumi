TODO NEXT:
- refactor results of passing "suite with zero tests"
	- use maven <prerequisites> element instead of verifier: http://maven.apache.org/pom.html
	!! - code generation for events
		OK - generate the source
		OK - find out how to integration test maven plugins
			- maven-mule-plugin looks like a good example on mojo unit testing support
			- shitty or invoker plugin appears to be best for integration testing
				http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3276739/getting-started-with-maven-plugin-testing
				http://mojo.codehaus.org/shitty-maven-plugin/
				http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-invoker-plugin/
				- examples in javascript-maven-tools
		OK - compile event interface sources as in maven-compiler-plugin, output to temp dir (unless it's a library class)
		OK - load classes from temp dir, use reflection to find out methods
		OK - write generated sources (maybe use a template for file headers etc.)
		OK - use project classpath in loading and compiling
		OK - more tests for using the compiler
		SKIP - generate stubs also for test sources?
		- rename code-generator-maven-plugin to jumi-actors-maven-plugin
	- put end-to-end tests in their own package (test.fi.jumi?), separate them from unit tests
		- or use JUnit categories, maybe with a custom runner?
	- making sure that non-thread-safe classes are used only from one thread
		- annotate classes with http://code.google.com/p/jsr-305/
		- create a Java agent and use it in end-to-end tests
- end-to-end tests: failing tests (includes reporting stack trace)
	- test execution might be best implemented using regular thread pools instead of actors
		- CPU bound threads should use an optimal number of threads per core
		- they take no input when running, so no actor handle needs to be created for them
		OK - the thing which coordinates a test class's workers might need to be an actor (it receives events from the tests), but it should also be able to exit itself when it has done its work
	- bullet proofing the public api, cross-references from javadocs to tests (a new xref tag?)
- end-to-end tests: failures outside tests (in drivers and core)
	- actor tests print dummy exceptions; solve by having a custom pluggable exception handler which doesn't print stack traces of a DummyException class
- end-to-end tests: reporting test output
- end-to-end tests: persistent daemon process
	- should drive better design on launcher side
	- connect to existing process
	- if daemon dies unexpectedly (System.exit/halt, JVM crash etc.), report it and restart next time
	- make it reliable

- organize the project so that it's possible to run unit tests separate from end-to-end tests
	- maybe using ClasspathSuite?

- "Error creating shaded jar", probably an issue with NTFS's pending delete and the shade plugin
	- make a bug request, maybe also a patch

- investigate warnings on build:
	- happens when jumi-core-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar (or daemon JAR) exits from the previous build

- Pronouncing Jumi: ['jumi]
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet

ROADMAP:
- Initial relase, technology preview
	- Runs tests on many cores
	- Custom JVM options
	- Caches library JARs
	- Make sure that test code cannot access the classes used by Jumi, except Jumi API; avoid library version conflicts using custom class loaders
	- Minimal console UI, shows only failing tests, configured using Java code
	- Debug tray GUI, shows only individual test runs (list of run IDs on left, run log on right; maybe also the test names in a tree, leftmost; print all test run data in log, but no colors or styles)
	- New runner for Specsy (Specsy 2: rewrite in Java, support more languages)
	- Publish a video demonstrating the speed. Use Dimdwarf as a sample project. Compare test run times:
		- Maven (only the test stage of the build)
		- IDEA
		- Eclipse
		- NetBeans
		- sbt (about same speed as Jumi?)
		- Jumi (1-thread, cold-start)
		- Jumi (1-thread, warm-start)
		- Jumi (4-thread, cold-start)
		- Jumi (4-thread, warm-start)

- Jumi Cluster, initial release
	- Runs tests on many machines (detects changed files and uploads them)
	- Simplest possible class-level distribution (round-robin over all machines, double-run test classes on local machine if the local machine runs out of work before the remote machines return their results)
	- Configuration using text files, no UI
	- Minimal single-user authentication (using Apache Shiro), no encryption
	- Release first with free evaluation licences, then build proper checkout systems and license checks

- Integration test project
	- Infrastructure for running tests against specified Jumi version
	- Tests for Jumi Cluster
	- Document and advertise it to framework developers

- Gather feedback and figure out what to build next (a proper UI perhaps; delay interaction design until here)

- Planned CORE features:
	- Build tool and IDE integration (Maven has the highest priority)
	- Well designed UI
	- Statistics (required by many other features)
	- Test priorization, run first those which will most probably fail, run fast tests first etc.
	- Per-module working directory (requires a separate JVM for each module)
	- IO/CPU boundness checking
	- Work around the issue of class loader locking the JARs (it's possible, though rare, that some JAR dependencies are generated by the same build)
	- Embed classmembersorter as a utility, in case framework developers would like to use it?
	- Faking "java.class.path", so that code which relies on it would not be disturbed by the use of multiple classloaders (should be optional and off by default?)

- Planned CLUSTER features:
	- Combine privileges from multiple licenses, limit concurrent users
	- Make buying a license easy, make sells scalable (fully automated)
	- Configuration UI (requires a plugin API)
	- Cloud provider integration (Amazon, others)
	- Provide startup scripts for the cluster daemon (Linux, Windows)
	- Location optimization: run fast tests locally
	- Distribute tests evenly over servers, based on expected duration
	- Test-level distribution (execute one test class over multiple servers)
	- Multi-environment test execution (e.g. run all tests on both Windows and Linux, or different JVM versions)
	- Multi-user authentication (per-user keys)
	- Encrypted communication over network (optional; takes CPU power)
